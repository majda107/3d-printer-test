# 3D printer test (all in one model)
> A universal tool that solves all your 3D printing problems

## What is this?
Hence I am a great fan of 3D printing community, I've decided to come up with my own testing model. This model tests the capabilities of your 3D printer and allows for clean comparison between other printers.

## That's awesome, how can I obtain STL file?
You can grab all STL files for free both here on GitHub or on my Thingiverse (link below), where you can find all sorts of usefull remixes!

## Is there any future roadmap?
Yes, I do plan to finish 3D printing guide and breathe life in 3D world again, so stay tuned and watch me on my thingiverse or social medias!
